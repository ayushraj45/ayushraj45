## What I Work On

- **AxiomSL Regulatory Reporting Software** - AxiomSL or AxiomCV is a niche specialty tool designed to streamline reg reporting, adopted by major banks around the world. 
- **AI‑powered products** – Designing and shipping assistants that combine LLMs, custom logic, and scheduling to solve real workflows (BizMitra, Coping AI).
- **Full‑stack web & mobile** – React, TypeScript, Vite, React Native, Expo, plus NodeJS and Spring Boot APIs with relational databases.
- **Cloud & infra** – Containerized backends, CI/CD, and practical AWS‑style deployment patterns for SaaS apps.

## How I Work

- **Product mindset** – Start from user workflows and constraints, then design systems that are maintainable and observable, not just “working code”.
- **End‑to‑end ownership** – Comfortable taking a feature from Figma/idea → backend contracts → frontend implementation → deployment and monitoring.
- **Documentation & clarity** – Treat READMEs, architecture notes, and onboarding docs as part of the product, making it easy for others to understand and extend my work.
